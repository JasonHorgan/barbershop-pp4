## User Experience

### Overview

Barbey's Barbershop is a website for a local barbershop based in Greystones, Ireland. I want to create a site that showcases what services are offered and allows users to easily book and manage appointments at their local barbershop 

#### First Time User

- I want to learn about a barbershop in Greystones
- I want to find clear and concise information about the barbers, services and price
- I want to be able to book appointments online and easily

#### Returning User 

- I want to be able to edit and delete appointments I have already booked 
- I want to view information on appointments I have had in the past so I can see who I booked with last time
